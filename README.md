NearTreat is a retail commerce platform aimed at empowering street food vendors and enthusiasts through Indic language support. The platform facilitates the discovery of street food vendors, enables menu availability updates, and fosters community building among users.

## Problem Statement

The street food vending ecosystem in India faces challenges due to language barriers and the lack of technology tailored to its needs. Existing food delivery apps primarily focus on restaurants, neglecting the street food segment. Language-specific needs of local vendors are not adequately addressed, leading to lost sales and customer engagement.

## Solution Overview

NearTreat addresses the identified gaps by providing a platform where street food vendors can update their live locations and menu offerings in Indic language. Users can effortlessly discover vendors, view menu options, and engage with the community. The platform emphasizes inclusivity and accessibility by supporting multiple Indic languages.

## Features

- **Search & Discovery:** Users can easily find street food vendors based on their current locations, presented in Indic language.
- **Menu Availability:** Vendors can update their menu offerings in Indic language, allowing users to know the available recipes in advance.
- **Community Building:** NearTreat fosters a vibrant community of Indic language-speaking street food enthusiasts, facilitating connections and culinary adventures.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Utilizes MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for development.
- **AI Capabilities:** Leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for language processing and scalability.
- **Security:** Implements robust protocols for secure communication and transactional guarantees.
